# Hello world in several programming languages

I've written and printed "Hello world!" from several programming languages. I
had a little knowledge about these languages (except Python). I thought why
not make them in use. That's why I made this project. In future I'll be adding
more languages here.

## Usage:

Clone this repository and then run the command below.

```sh
./hello-world
```
